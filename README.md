# Grove_LCD_RGB_Clock

Grove LCD-RGB-Backlight Real-Time-Clock (RTC) and Temperature Display

This project will combine a series of Grove components, into a nice and colorful, time and temperature display, using:

- Grove LCD RGB Backlight - display
- Grove RTC DS1307 - real-time clock
- more to come
